His research focuses on developing techniques to analyze online behaviors to improve individual well-being and address societal problems using online data. Prior to joining Sabanci University, he was a postdoctoral researcher at Northeastern University at the Center for Complex Network Research. He completed his PhD in Informatics at Indiana University, Bloomington (USA). His thesis focuses on the analysis of manipulation and threats on social media and he was awarded the 2018 University Distinguished Ph.D. Dissertation Award. He has developed a system called <a href=\"http://botometer.iuni.iu.edu\" target=\"_blank\">Botometer</a> to detect social bots on Twitter and his team ranked top 3 worldwide at the 2015 DARPA Bot Detection Challenge. Efforts on studying social bots yield publications on prestigious venues such as <i>International Conference of Web and Social Media</i> (ICWSM), <i>Nature Communications</i>, <i>World Wide Web</i> (WWW) conference, and <i>Communications of the ACM</i>. He interned at Microsoft Research for two summers during his PhD to develop causal analysis of large-scale social media timelines. He is currently working on quantifying success of online personas and impact of their actions. He is also modeling user interactions, leveraging online data across multiple platforms to understand conscious and unconscious behaviors.",
